Version 1.3.0
[06/01/2021 - 1st June, 2021]

- Bug fix
- Improved cutscenes
- Official Portuguese Brazilian translation

This is the last version of Elementalism (Demo) yes, really real :v

I fixed a mini bug of the version in the title image, it was
(Demo) Version 3.0.0.1, without me realizing that I hadn't changed,
sorry, but it gave me agony.

I improved the cutscenes to have more context than it's
happening, I thought that in the previous version it was terrible so
I changed ;-;

And finally the official translation of Elementalism (Demo). I did it because
the Brazilian community was growing, and it was also having difficulties
of what was happening. Thanks to Junior Schueller for giving me
this idea of translating!

I was bored out of this quarantine so I needed to do this.

Maybe I'll do some bonus things, not so much because the full game
is not available (everyone knows it.)

I'm still going to bring some little news about the game soon.

That's it... thanks to everyone who liked the game and also the community
for helping and supporting the game :D

Take care and bye!
