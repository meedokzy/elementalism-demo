Version 3.0.0.1
[09/08/2020 - 8 September, 2020]

- Launch Day

Finally the day came :D

It took 6 months to produce, songs, sprites, cutscenes, scripts,
it was literally everything.

The scripts I just modified the defaults of the RPG Maker engine itself,
but I will give credit to the people who made the other script
game modification.

I put the credits, because then you will think that I did it
the full script of the demo. (and I also feel guilty for not putting the
in-game credits ;-;). Ruby code, it's kind of complicated, so
I didn’t have the patience to learn. (actually I don't even know where to learn :v).

I did all the songs for hours as my FL Studio was trial (limited).

Thank you so much for my friends and the Firettle Team for helping me
in this demo ^-^

Maybe the next updates will come in this demo, stay tuned. ;)
